# IPL-Match-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting match outcomes in the Indian Premier League (IPL) using Machine Learning techniques. The objective is to build a predictive model that analyzes historical IPL data and estimates the probability of a team winning a match based on multiple influencing factors. The dataset includes match-level information such as teams playing, venue, toss winner, toss decision, match results, runs scored, wickets taken, and player of the match.

The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and key performance indicators. Feature engineering techniques are applied to transform categorical variables and create meaningful input features for modeling. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost are implemented and compared based on evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Cross-validation is used to improve model reliability and prevent overfitting.

Among the tested models, ensemble-based algorithms demonstrated superior performance due to their ability to capture complex relationships in match data. The final trained model can be used to predict match outcomes for upcoming games based on selected input parameters. This project showcases practical skills in data analysis, model development, performance evaluation, and predictive analytics, making it a strong portfolio project for data science and machine learning roles.
